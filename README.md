# Physically Based Rendering
![](readme_files/lantern.gif)

We have implemented physical based rendering in OpenGL using Cook-Torrance BRDF and are using image based lighting for the ambient lighting.

## Build Instructions
The application was developed using Visual Studio 2017, open the 'lantern_viewer.sln' in the 'lantern_viewer' folder and it should compile without any issues.

Please note, the libraries are only installed for x64, if you change the build target to x86 it will break.

## Theory
We learned about this technique from [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/PBR/Theory) and can recommend the source for the curious person, since they have explained the concept really well.
